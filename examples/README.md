## Demo Bundles

| Directory | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| [agent_improvement_cycle/](agent_improvement_cycle/) | LoopAgent-driven prompt improvement cycle |
| [skill_evolution_lab/](skill_evolution_lab/) | An agent that rewrites its own versioned `SKILL.md` from its conversation traces (no teacher model): flawed V0 → `evolve_skill()` → tool-first V1, golden-Q&A scored, with the anti-parroting rule and Skill Registry versioning. See the dedicated section below. |
| [decision_lineage_demo/](decision_lineage_demo/) | Decision-lineage property graph (issue #98): live ADK media-planner agent + BQ AA Plugin running across 6 campaign sessions → SDK `build_context_graph(use_ai_generate=True, include_decisions=True)` → six GQL blocks pasted into BigQuery Studio (one renders an interactive graph diagram, one is a portfolio roll-up) |

### Skill Evolution Lab — a self-improving agent

[`skill_evolution_lab/`](skill_evolution_lab/) is the runnable companion to the
blog post *"Your Agent Can Write Its Own Skill."* One company-policy Q&A agent
reads its own conversation traces — successes and failures — and extracts a
structured, versioned `SKILL.md`. No teacher model, no managed optimizer.

- **The flaw with headroom.** V0 is a deliberately flawed skill (a few facts
  baked in plus *"answer only from the above, else contact HR"*) that suppresses
  a tool which already knows every answer. Only the skill is wrong — the model,
  tools, and questions stay fixed across V0 and V1, so any delta is attributable
  to the skill.
- **The engine, imported not copied.** `analyze_and_evolve.py` imports the SDK's
  reusable [`scripts/skill_evolution.py`](../../scripts/skill_evolution.py) (the
  same `evolve_skill()` the quality lab uses): it partitions scored
  conversations, runs a fleet of parallel analysts, and consolidates recurring
  rules into a new skill version.
- **Ground-truth scoring.** Quality is graded against a golden Q&A answer key
  (`eval/eval_spec.json`) via [`scripts/quality_report.py`](../../scripts/quality_report.py)
  (`--eval-spec`), not a no-ground-truth "usefulness" guess.
- **The anti-parroting rule.** Multi-turn cases where the user asserts a *wrong*
  correction; a good agent re-verifies with its tool and holds the right figure
  instead of caving. The engine detects parroting (`--tag-turns`) and learns a
  "re-verify, don't just agree" rule.
- **Skill Registry versioning.** The evolved skill is mirrored to the Gemini
  Enterprise Agent Platform Skill Registry as a new immutable revision
  (V0 = revision 1, V1 = revision 2); `reset.sh` reverts both the local copy and
  the registry to V0.

```bash
cd skill_evolution_lab
./setup.sh YOUR_PROJECT_ID us-central1   # writes .env, resets to V0
./run_e2e_demo.sh                        # V0 -> evolve -> V1 -> compare, restore V0
```

A verified run (gemini-3-flash-preview, golden-grounded, held-out): **V0 23.8% →
V1 100%** overall; corrections (anti-parroting) **33.3% → 100%**; evolved skill
2.5KB. See the example's [README](skill_evolution_lab/README.md),
[BLOG](skill_evolution_lab/BLOG.md), and
[VERIFICATION](skill_evolution_lab/VERIFICATION.md).

## Reference Artifacts

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [e2e_demo_output.txt](e2e_demo_output.txt) | Expected output from e2e_demo.py |
| [ymgo_graph_spec.yaml](ymgo_graph_spec.yaml) | Example ontology YAML specification **(legacy)** |

> **Note:** `ontology_graph_v4_demo.ipynb` and `ymgo_graph_spec.yaml` use the legacy combined
> `GraphSpec` format. The current approach uses separated ontology + binding YAML files with
> `load_ontology()` + `load_binding()` from `bigquery_ontology`. See `ontology_graph_v5_demo.ipynb`
> or `migration_v5_demo_notebook.ipynb`.
