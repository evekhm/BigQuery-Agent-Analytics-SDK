# Skill Evolution Lab

An agent that **rewrites its own skill** from its conversation traces — no
teacher model, no managed optimizer. One company-policy Q&A agent starts with a
deliberately flawed `SKILL.md`, generates traffic, and the SDK's evolution
engine reads the failing trajectories and produces a small, tool-first V1 skill.
The skill is versioned in the **Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform Skill
Registry** (V0 = revision 1, V1 = revision 2).

This is the runnable companion to the blog post *"Your Agent Can Write Its Own
Skill."* See [`BLOG.md`](BLOG.md) for the full story and
[`VERIFICATION.md`](VERIFICATION.md) for a recorded end-to-end run.

## What it shows

- **Self-improvement from traces.** The engine
  (`scripts/skill_evolution.py`, imported here — not copied) partitions scored
  conversations into successes/failures, runs a fleet of parallel analysts, and
  consolidates recurring rules into a versioned `SKILL.md`.
- **Ground-truth scoring.** Quality is graded against a golden Q&A answer key
  (`eval/eval_spec.json`) via the SDK's `quality_report.py`, not a
  no-ground-truth "usefulness" guess.
- **The anti-parroting rule.** Multi-turn cases where the user asserts a *wrong*
  correction. A good agent re-verifies with its tool and holds the right figure
  instead of caving. The engine detects parroting and learns a "re-verify, don't
  just agree" rule. (See [BLOG.md](BLOG.md#corrections-are-not-answers-the-anti-parroting-rule).)
- **Skill Registry versioning.** The evolved skill is mirrored to the registry
  as a new immutable revision; `reset.sh` reverts both the local copy and the
  registry to V0.

```

A complete recorded run lives in [`sample_run/`](sample_run/) — the scored V0/V1
reports, the evolved skill, and `RESULT.md` — so you can read the exact inputs and
outputs (and what each file means) without running anything. Live runs write to
`runs/<timestamp>/` (git-ignored).

## Prerequisites

- A GCP project with Vertex AI enabled; `roles/aiplatform.user`.
- `gcloud auth application-default login`.
- [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (used to run with the repo's deps).
- Gemini 3.x models are served from the Vertex `global` endpoint (handled
  automatically); the Skill Registry is regional (`us-central1` by default).

## Run it

```bash
cd examples/skill_evolution_lab
./setup.sh YOUR_PROJECT_ID us-central1      # writes .env, resets to V0
./run_e2e_demo.sh                           # V0 -> evolve -> V1 -> compare
```

The run deploys the flawed V0, generates and scores traffic on the evolve and
held-out test sets, evolves a tool-first V1 skill, re-scores the held-out set,
prints the V0→V1 comparison, and restores V0. Artifacts land in
`runs/<timestamp>_<model>/` (git-ignored), with `RESULT.md` as the summary.

### With the Skill Registry

```bash
WITH_REGISTRY=1 SKILL_ID=skill-lab-policy ./setup.sh YOUR_PROJECT_ID us-central1
WITH_REGISTRY=1 SKILL_ID=skill-lab-policy ./run_e2e_demo.sh
WITH_REGISTRY=1 SKILL_ID=skill-lab-policy ./reset.sh   # revert local + registry
```

Inspect revisions any time: `uv run python registry_cli.py revisions
--skill-id skill-lab-policy`.

### Model overrides

```bash
AGENT_MODEL=gemini-3.1-pro-preview ANALYST_MODEL=gemini-3.1-pro-preview ./run_e2e_demo.sh
```

`AGENT_MODEL` is the agent under test; `ANALYST_MODEL` runs the evolution
analysts/consolidator; `JUDGE_MODEL` (default `gemini-2.5-flash`, regional)
scores. The model, tools, and questions are fixed across V0 and V1 — only the
skill changes — so any delta is attributable to the skill.

## How it relates to the research

The engine follows [Trace2Skill](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.25158) (parallel
analysts + inductive consolidation, held-out validation) and
[AutoSkill](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.01145) (versioned skill evolution as a
semantic merge). It is the same `evolve_skill()` the knowledge-supervisor
quality lab imports from this SDK.
