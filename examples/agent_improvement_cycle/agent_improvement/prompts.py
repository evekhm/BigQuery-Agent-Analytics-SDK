Question: {question}
Response: {response}

Return JSON with exactly these fields:
{{
  "pass": true or false,
  "reason": "one-sentence explanation"

A response PASSES if it provides a specific, substantive answer to the question.
A response FAILS if it says "I don't know", defers to HR, or gives vague/generic information without specifics.

IMPROVER_PROMPT = """You are an agent prompt engineer. Your job is to improve an AI agent's system prompt based on quality evaluation results.

## Current Agent Prompt (version {current_version})
```
{current_prompt}
```

## Quality Report Summary
- Total sessions: {total_sessions}
- Meaningful (helpful): {meaningful} ({meaningful_rate}%)
- Partial: {partial}
- Unhelpful: {unhelpful} ({unhelpful_rate}%)

## Unhelpful and Partial Sessions (these need fixing)
{problem_sessions}

## Available Tools
The agent has these tools available:
{tool_signatures}

## Your Task
Analyze the unhelpful/partial sessions and improve the agent prompt to fix these issues. The agent has tools that can answer these questions, but the prompt doesn't guide the agent to use them properly.

Rules:
1. Keep the prompt concise (under 500 words)
2. Add specific guidance for topics where the agent failed
3. Add instructions to ALWAYS use the available tools before answering
4. Keep all existing correct behavior
5. Do NOT remove information that was working correctly

Return your response as JSON with exactly these fields:
{{
  "improved_prompt": "the full improved prompt text",
  "changes_summary": "brief description of what changed and why"
}}

Return ONLY the JSON, no other text.
