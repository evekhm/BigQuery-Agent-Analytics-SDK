# ============================================================================
# Agent Improvement Cycle Orchestrator
# ============================================================================
#
# This script runs a closed-loop improvement cycle for an ADK agent:
#
#   STEP 1: SIMULATE USER TRAFFIC (run_eval.py)
#       Sends test questions from eval_cases.json to the agent.
#       Each question creates a real agent session (tool calls, LLM responses)
#       that gets automatically logged to BigQuery via BigQueryAgentAnalyticsPlugin.
#
#       Think of this as "synthetic user traffic." In production, real users
#       would generate these sessions naturally. For the demo, we use eval
#       cases to simulate that traffic so we have sessions to analyze.
#
#   STEP 2: EVALUATE SESSION QUALITY (quality_report.py from the SDK)
#       Reads the sessions that were just logged to BigQuery and evaluates
#       each one: Was the agent's response actually helpful? Was it grounded
#       in tool output or did the agent hallucinate?
#
#       The SDK's quality_report.py handles this. It uses --app-name to filter
#       to sessions from our agent only, and --output-json to produce a
#       structured report that the improver can consume programmatically.
#
#   STEP 3: AUTO-IMPROVE THE PROMPT (improve_agent.py)
#       Reads the quality report JSON and sends it to Gemini along with the
#       current agent prompt. Gemini analyzes which sessions failed and why,
#       then generates:
#         - An improved prompt that fixes the identified issues
#         - New eval cases that specifically test those fixes
#
#       The improved prompt is written to agent/prompts.py as PROMPT_V{N+1},
#       and CURRENT_PROMPT is updated to point to it. New eval cases are
#       appended to eval/eval_cases.json so the same failures are caught
#       in future cycles.
#
# The hero moment: run 3 cycles and watch quality climb from ~30% to ~90%+.
#
# Usage:
#   ./run_cycle.sh              # Run one improvement cycle
#   ./run_cycle.sh --cycles 3   # Run 3 consecutive cycles
#   ./run_cycle.sh --eval-only  # Only run Steps 1-2, skip improvement
