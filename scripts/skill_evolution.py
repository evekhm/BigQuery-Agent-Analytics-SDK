"""Skill evolution: turn a scored quality report into a better SKILL.md.

Consumes a quality report (e.g. from quality_report.py) and the agent's
current ``SKILL.md`` and produces an improved skill via a fleet of parallel,
independent LLM "analysts" whose patches are merged by an inductive
consolidator. Implements the core of Trace2Skill (arXiv:2603.25158, parallel
analysts + inductive consolidation) and AutoSkill (arXiv:2603.01145, the
accumulative ``P_merge`` that preserves capability identity).

Design: the engine has no agent/traffic/registry dependencies. Candidate
selection (best-of-N) is delegated to a caller-supplied ``score_fn`` so the
same engine serves any agent. Import it like quality_report:

    evolve = import_sdk_module("skill_evolution")
    new_skill = evolve.evolve_skill(report, current_skill, score_fn=my_scorer)

Or run as a CLI:

    python skill_evolution.py --report report.json --skill SKILL.md -o V1.md

Auth: uses Vertex AI via the google-genai client. Set GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT and
GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION (or pass project/location), and authenticate with ADC
(gcloud auth application-default login).

ERROR_ANALYST_PROMPT = """\
You are an Error Analyst in a skill evolution system. You examine a single
FAILED agent trajectory to identify what went wrong and propose a specific,
GENERALIZABLE improvement to the agent's skill document.

You receive the current skill document and a failed trajectory (which may be
multi-turn and may include an execution trace of tool calls and routing).

Analysis process:
1. Read the trajectory. If a [CORRECTION] turn is present, extract BOTH what the
   agent claimed (the wrong fact) AND what the user corrected it to (the right
   fact) -- that is direct evidence of a skill gap.
2. If an execution trace is present, use it as ground truth: did the agent skip a
   tool call (HALLUCINATION), call the wrong tool (KEYWORD_GAP), ignore a tool
   result (MISSING_RULE), get routed wrong (SCOPE_GAP), or merely echo the user's
   correction without re-verifying via a tool (PARROTING)?
3. Identify the ROOT CAUSE -- why the skill document did not prevent this -- and
   categorize it: KEYWORD_GAP, MISSING_RULE, AMBIGUITY, SCOPE_GAP, HALLUCINATION,
   PARROTING, or CORRECTION_IGNORE.
4. Propose a concrete patch that generalizes beyond this one question.

Output format (use exactly this structure):

## Root Cause
[CATEGORY]: [one-line description]

## Analysis
[2-3 sentences. Cite the specific wrong claim + user correction, or specific tool
calls (or their absence), as evidence.]

## Proposed Patch
Section: [which section of the skill to modify or create]
Action: add_rule | add_mapping | add_edge_case | add_anti_pattern
Content:
[The exact text to add. Must generalize beyond this single trajectory.]

RULES:
- Patches must GENERALIZE; be specific and actionable, not vague.
- User corrections are FACTUAL EVIDENCE -- use them to write precise rules.
- If the failure has no generalizable fix, output "NO_PATCH: [reason]".
"""

SUCCESS_ANALYST_PROMPT = """\
You are a Success Analyst in a skill evolution system. You examine a single
SUCCESSFUL agent trajectory to identify transferable patterns worth reinforcing
in the agent's skill document.

You receive the current skill document and a successful trajectory (question,
response, judge verdict; possibly multi-turn).

IMPORTANT -- PARROTED RECOVERIES ARE NOT SUCCESS: if the agent merely repeated the
user's correction without re-querying a tool (a [~] parroted segment), output
"NO_PATCH: parroted recovery, not a transferable success pattern."

Analysis process:
1. Identify what the agent did RIGHT that is NOT already explicit in the skill.
2. Focus on transferable patterns: KEYWORD_MAPPING, RESPONSE_PATTERN,
   DISAMBIGUATION, TOOL_USAGE, or CORRECTION_RECOVERY.

Output format (use exactly this structure):

## Pattern
[CATEGORY]: [one-line description]

## Analysis
[2-3 sentences on what worked and why it is worth reinforcing.]

## Proposed Patch
Section: [which section of the skill to modify or create]
Action: reinforce_pattern | add_mapping | add_example
Content:
[The exact text to add. Must generalize beyond this one question.]

RULES:
- Only propose patches for patterns NOT already in the skill.
- If the skill already covers it, output "NO_PATCH: skill already covers this".
"""

CONSOLIDATOR_PROMPT = """\
You are a Skill Merger. You receive a BASE skill document and patches from
analyst agents who independently examined execution trajectories.

Your job is an ACCUMULATIVE MERGE, not a rewrite. Produce the SEMANTIC UNION of
the base skill and the patches (AutoSkill's P_merge -- versioned evolution that
preserves capability identity).

Merge rules (follow ALL):
1. Preserve identity: keep the same name, purpose, and overall structure.
2. Never drop existing content. Every section, rule, and table row in the BASE
   MUST appear in your output unless a patch explicitly corrects it (then update
   that rule in place). Dropping an existing section is a failure.
3. Semantic union, not concatenation: integrate each patch into the right section.
4. Prevalence: insights from many independent analysts are systematic -- integrate
   confidently; 1-2 analyst one-offs only if clearly general.
5. Deduplicate: state a repeated insight once, in the clearest wording.
6. Import only reusable, non-conflicting additions; strip case-specific entities
   and analyst scratch notes ("NO_PATCH", "Root Cause:").
7. Do not invent figures or policies absent from the base or a patch.
8. A skill is BEHAVIORAL: do NOT bake specific data values (numbers, dates,
   dollar amounts, limits) into it -- those must come from tools at runtime, and
   copies go stale or wrong. Keep rules and tool-usage guidance; never paste
   tool-result facts pulled from a trajectory. (Preserve any data already in the
   base verbatim, but add no new specific values.)
9. On conflict, keep the better-evidenced patch.

Output the COMPLETE merged SKILL.md (frontmatter + full body):
- YAML frontmatter between --- delimiters: keep name/description; set
  metadata.version = base version + 1 ("0"->"1"); metadata.author =
  skill-evolution; metadata.evolved_from = base version.
- The full body = every base section (verbatim or refined in place) plus new
  sections motivated by patches (e.g. Keyword Mappings, Edge Cases, Anti-Patterns,
  Out-of-Scope Handling).

Self-check before output: does every "## " heading from the base still appear? If
not, add it back.
"""

COMPACTION_PROMPT = """\
You are a Skill Compactor. Distill an evolved skill that grew too large to under
{max_chars} characters while preserving effectiveness.

Keep all mandatory tool-use rules and anti-hallucination directives verbatim.
Merge redundant rules (keep the most specific), compress obvious keyword mappings,
remove filler, and preserve section headings and numbered lists.

Output the COMPLETE compacted SKILL.md including YAML frontmatter. Keep the same
