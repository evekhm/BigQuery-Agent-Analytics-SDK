## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.1] - 2026-08-29

### Release highlights

An evaluation-focused wheel update and a rebuilt dashboard entrance. The
wheel gains the EvalBench BigQuery run reader
(`bigquery_agent_analytics.evalbench`), the canonical evaluation rubrics
(`bigquery_agent_analytics.evaluation_rubrics`), and the golden Q&A
matching producer (`bigquery_agent_analytics.golden_matching`), plus a CLI
judge-feedback escaping fix. The published Looker Studio configurator (repo/live-template
side) collapses its three identifier fields into a single fully qualified
table-ID input, and the template's external accessibility is now an
attested, monitored contract after a real external-user failure (#445).

### Added

- **EvalBench BigQuery run reader (#444)** — new
  `bigquery_agent_analytics.evalbench` module: reads EvalBench evaluation
  runs from BigQuery and maps imported runs onto BQAA traces, with
  corrected imported-trace semantics. Reference doc in `docs/evalbench.md`.
- **Canonical evaluation rubrics in core (#430, #431)** — new
  `bigquery_agent_analytics.evaluation_rubrics` module extracts the
  canonical 8-metric rubric data (response usefulness with the
  scope-conditional declined category, task grounding, correctness, tool
  usage, specificity, scope compliance, first-time-right, failure
  attribution) and the interpreter (`builtin_metric_config()`,
  `build_metrics()`) from `quality_report`, which now consumes them.
  Rubric reference doc in `docs/evaluation_rubrics.md`.
- **Golden Q&A matching in core (#428, #432)** — new
  `bigquery_agent_analytics.golden_matching` module, the producer side of
  answer-key grounding whose consumer landed in #378: `embed_texts()`
  (L2-normalised vectors with bounded 429/503 retry),
  `DEFAULT_GOLDEN_THRESHOLD` (0.92), and `match_golden_qa()` mapping
  session questions to golden expected answers and out-of-scope decline
  notes ready for `evaluate_categorical(per_session_context=...)` —
  extracted verbatim from `quality_report`, which now consumes it, with
  the three names exported at the package top level.

### Fixed

- **CLI: LLM judge feedback rendering (#438)** — judge feedback quotes are
  escaped and the max-length cap is applied correctly.
- **Examples (#426, #427)** — the Colab notebook authenticates before
  creating the BigQuery client, and the context-graph example reads
  `BQ_LOCATION` with a discoverable dataset location.

### Dashboard (repo and live-template side, not in the wheel)

- **Single fully-qualified table-ID entrance (#448, #449)** — the
  configurator's three identifier fields collapse into one
  `project.dataset.table` input (superseding #403's separate-fields
  decision while keeping its per-segment diagnostics): a five-state
  fail-closed field machine, whole-field vs segment-level error classes
  with sentinel collisions gating Ready, an explicit Enter activation
  bridge (repeat/IME-safe), billing-gated actionability, paste takeover for
  every supported form, and unchanged three-parameter setup links and
  Linking API URLs. The browser smoke re-anchors on a runtime
  app-initialized marker with a live-state snapshot and nine negative
  fixtures.
- **BigQuery Console table links accepted (#424)** — pasting a Console
  table URL fills the configurator; unambiguous single-table workspaces on
  both supported hosts parse, everything else fails closed.
- **External template access is an attested contract (#445, #446)** — after
  an external user hit the terminal "This report isn't shared with you"
  dialog, `bindings/report_template.yaml` gains a two-control
  `external_access_verification` attestation (Permissions API link-role
  read with the `datastudio.readonly` scope; dated external-identity copy
  canary scoped by identity class), a durable `known_live_issues` record,
  an evidence-consistent status contract enforced by tests, and a weekly
  staleness workflow (`external-access-staleness.yml`) that opens a
  tracking issue when the canary is overdue. All user-facing docs now name
  the terminal dialog and stop advising users to wait it out.
- **End-user manual (#425)** — `dashboard/looker_studio/USER_MANUAL.md`:
  prerequisites, three-step setup, page guide, troubleshooting.

### Grafana

- **Metric correctness and scan bounds (#373 follow-ups, #433)** — LLM
  calls are counted per distinct trace/span (streaming chunks no longer
  overcount), every public-demo query enforces a strict half-open 72-hour
  window per table scan, and the sync lint gains block-comment stripping,
  foreign-table-path detection, and negative regression tests.
- **One-command local run (#421, #422)** — from checkout to a rendering
  dashboard against a local fixture dataset.

### Documentation

- LangSmith re-export guidance corrected and the 24-hour ingest window
  documented (#423); thinking-token accounting clarified (#441); BigQuery
  concept-index semantics clarified (#439); time-series point-marker
  requirement recorded (#437).

### Infrastructure

- CI pins `pyink<26` so the Format check tracks the style the repository
  is actually formatted in (#447).

## [0.5.0] - 2026-08-11

### Release highlights

Two new export/observability surfaces and a rebuilt dashboard first-run
experience. The wheel gains the BigQuery-to-LangSmith export connector
(`bqaa export langsmith`) and the native Grafana integration; the published
Looker Studio dashboard (repo/live-template side, tracked in #404) now
defaults to one rolling 90-day report-level date control across all eight
pages, ships a trust-hardened configurator, and is guarded by a
browser-level CI gate.

### Added

- **BigQuery-to-LangSmith export connector (#410, #414)** — new
  `bigquery_agent_analytics.export` subpackage plus the `bqaa export
  langsmith` CLI: dumps BQAA `agent_events` rows to a LangSmith project,
  schema/row-content agnostic, with bounded batching and structured error
  handling. Verified against a real LangSmith project.
- **Native Grafana dashboard integration (#339, #373).**
- **Skill-evolution lab on the shared-table, server-side path (#360 U6)** —
  the two disclosed demo workarounds are removed now that #358/#359 have
  landed: the lab writes every pass to one shared `agent_events` table
  (rows labeled `custom_tags {run, slice}`, with reused held-out session ids
  separated by the identity-safe selectors) and judges server-side with each
  session's matched golden expected answer as identity-bound per-session
  context. Scoring is bounded by app + exact run/slice labels + a 24h window
  + a 500-row cap, and `quality_report`'s trajectory fetch now preserves
  those CLI bounds when delegating to `TraceFilter`. The committed
  `sample_run/` is a fresh recording of this end-to-end path (provenance in
  `sample_run/PROVENANCE.md`). This closes the #358/#359 release-notes arc:
  the example now exercises the shared-table, server-side contract end to
  end.

### Changed (dashboard, repo/live-template side — issue #404)

- **Configurator accepts a pasted fully qualified table ID (#403, #405)** —
  `project.dataset.table` (plus backticked, legacy-colon, and
  trailing-punctuation forms) pastes into any field and distributes across
  all three, with paste-immediate and change-committed semantics that never
  hijack hand-typing. Community contribution.
- **First-run trust cluster (#398, #399, #400, #408)** — the create flow
  sets a measured ~10-second provisioning expectation before and at the
  click, step 02 mirrors the real "Review data access" dialog (exact SQL
  linked, Owner's-Credentials mode explained), and the page moved to a
  WCAG-AA-verified Google Cloud palette in both themes. The recurring
  dialog comparison is a durable "Configurator release checks" contract.
- **Rolling 90-day report-level date range (#401, #417)** — one date
  control now applies to and persists across all eight report pages,
  including the Trace Inspector, replacing the 365-day page-scoped
  defaults; republished under the full nine-method publication gate with
  re-dated attestations, a validated 1280 px minimum viewport, and a
  recorded bytes-billed measurement.
- **Browser-level configurator CI gate (#407)** — headless-Chrome smoke
  check with instrumented page-error detection, nonce-verified server
  ownership, honored browser exit status, and five negative fixtures, all
  enforced through the required test matrix (a Node-only suite cannot see
  browser-fatal failures).

### Fixed

- **Lock generation converges again under pip 26.2 (#412)** and GitHub
  Actions workflows hardened for the zizmor policy (#411); `nanoid`
  upgraded past its advisory (#413).

### Decisions

- **Conversational Analytics over `agent_events` (#402, #409, #416)** —
  decision framework plus a completed authenticated evaluation: the
  first-party BigQuery data agent shared to Data Studio (B1) is selected
  (both stage-1 shapes scored 6/6; no first-party mandatory failure), and
  implementation is handed off to #418. Dashboard usage attribution is
  tracked as evidence-gated backlog in #415.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-07-30

_Section cut retroactively: the `v0.4.1` tag (2026-07-30) shipped these
entries, but the changelog section was not carved out of Unreleased at
release time._

### Added

- **Identity-safe singular trace resolution (#359)** — `TraceIdentity`,
  `TraceScope`, `TraceSelector`, `ResolvedTraceSelector`, and
  `AmbiguousSessionError` distinguish a reusable conversation `session_id`
  across users, root agents, experiments, and exact custom-label payloads.
  `Client.get_session_trace()` now resolves candidates without a newest-wins
  fallback; `Client.get_trace_by_selector()` accepts a retry-ready candidate
  selector. Scalar pins distinguish unpinned, SQL `NULL`, and string values,
  and canonical `scope_signature` values make subset/superset label scopes
  distinct. `allow_mixed_scope=True` is an explicit single-identity escape
  hatch and reports its included scopes through `Trace.scope_coverage`.
- **Identity-safe secondary surfaces** — GQL reconstruction, flat fallback,
  `BigQueryTraceEvaluator`, CLI `get-trace`, Remote Function `analyze`, the
  self-monitoring agent example, and quality/latency reports now use the shared
  selector contract. CLI JSON and Remote Function errors expose structured,
  exact retry selectors; human-readable ambiguity messages remain redacted.
  Reports retain colliding rows when score attribution is available, fail
  closed rather than attaching a legacy session-only score to one candidate,
  and render resolved identity plus exact scope (or mixed-scope coverage) in
  text, Markdown, and JSON.
- **Identity-bound categorical judge context (#358 U4)** —
  `Client.evaluate_categorical(..., per_session_context=...)` accepts exact
  `ResolvedTraceSelector` keys, plus legacy session-id keys only when the
  filtered population is unambiguous. A non-empty mapping resolves and
  deduplicates the U2 identity/scope population before any model call, bypasses
  AI.CLASSIFY with a recorded reason, and carries the same parameterized
  transcript/context binding through BigQuery AI.GENERATE, parse/NULL retry,
  and full Gemini API fallback. Unmapped traces still run without context;
  empty resolved work makes no model call. Context-aware logs redact model
  text/raw retry responses so a model echo cannot disclose trusted context.
- **Identity-safe categorical persistence and latest views (#358 U5)** —
  categorical result tables gain nullable identity and context-provenance
  columns through idempotent additive migrations; historical rows are not
  backfilled. Deploy and roll back in schema → writer → view order. Latest
  views preserve separate rows for identities that share a `session_id`; while
  data straddles the migration, a sole typed identity supersedes matching
  legacy metric/prompt rows, while zero or multiple identities retain the
  `legacy:<session_id>` lane. Trusted judge/golden-answer input and model
  echoes are never persisted — only SDK-owned provenance is. U5 closes the
  remaining #358 persistence/report gate and unlocks U6/#360.

### Changed

- **Migration guidance for session readers** — code that assumed
  `session_id` uniquely identified one trace must now catch
  `AmbiguousSessionError`, choose a candidate according to application policy,
  and pass the complete `candidate["selector"]` to `TraceSelector` and
  `get_trace_by_selector()`. Preserve explicit JSON `null` pins and
  `scope_signature`; dropping either can broaden a retry. Callers whose
  `session_id` resolves uniquely continue unchanged; callers that need every
  candidate can use `list_traces()` instead of a singular read. Legacy
  session-only report correlation remains supported only when exactly one
  candidate exists and otherwise fails closed.
- Rows with the same intrinsic identity and exact scope are indistinguishable
  to the selector contract and resolve as one candidate. Producers that need a
  finer boundary should record a distinct experiment/label scope or use their
  producer `trace_id`.
- Structured ambiguity payloads contain user/root-agent/experiment/label
  metadata and should be handled as sensitive data. They never include event
  content or judge context.
- This release aligns read, trajectory-evaluation, CLI/Remote Function,
  example, report, and categorical judge-context surfaces at one boundary.
  Context is trusted prompt material: it is a query parameter/model input,
  never SQL text, a job label, or persisted input. U5 now provides the
  identity-safe persistence/view-cardinality path for contextual results.

### Fixed

- **dashboard_v2: React Router upgraded past GHSA-qwww-vcr4-c8h2 (#394)**
  and postcss bumped (#393).

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-18

### Release highlights

Richer analytics out of the box. A new `retail-returns` seed scenario gives
token-usage and latency demos real data to query the moment you seed a
dataset, the SDK's type surfaces now recognize the ADK 2.0 event vocabulary
end to end, and the quality report graduates from two pass/fail metrics to a
diagnostic view that tells you *why* a session failed and *what to fix*.

### Added

- **`retail-returns` seed-events scenario** — `bqaa seed-events --scenario
  retail-returns` generates a multi-agent refund/exchange trace (intake-triage,
  fraud-abuse, quality-defect) with `LLM_REQUEST`/`LLM_RESPONSE` token-usage
  and latency telemetry, so token/latency analytics and the `v_llm_response`
  view's `usage_*_tokens` / `total_ms` / `ttft_ms` columns are non-empty
  immediately. Emits one terminal `AGENT_COMPLETED` per session, deterministic
  outcome buckets (surfaced via `session_outcome_counts`), product-quality
  feedback text, and `legacy_crm_db` diagnostic errors for filterable demo
  queries. Output is deterministic for a fixed `(seed, now)`; existing
  `decision` / `decision-realistic` scenarios are unchanged and byte-identical.
- **ADK 2.0 event types across the SDK type surfaces** — the four
  #293-shipped event types are registered with full typed views and the two
  workflow-boundary types as header-only, across every consumer type surface,
  and `TOOL_COMPLETED` is extended with the long-running pair keys.
- **`SystemEvaluator`** as the preferred name for deterministic/code-defined
  metrics. `CodeEvaluator` is kept as a backward-compatible alias; calling
  `CodeEvaluator()` now emits `evaluator_name="system_evaluator"`.
- **Expanded quality report** — adds quality dimensions, correction analysis,
  execution traces, golden-Q&A grounding, and version filtering, so a failing
  session shows why it failed, whether the answer is correct, and what to fix
  (beyond the original `response_usefulness` / `task_grounding` pass/fail
  metrics).

## [0.3.4] - 2026-06-10

### Release highlights

Consume the graph you already deployed. `bqaa context-graph --graph <name>`
reads your property graph's definition back from BigQuery's
`INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PROPERTY_GRAPHS` and derives the ontology + binding from
it plus the live table schemas — no SQL file is passed to (or staged for) the
materializer. You deploy the graph with standard `bq` DDL once; from then on
the deployed graph is the single source of truth, so what you query with GQL
and what gets materialized can never drift apart. The docs (codelab, blog,
scheduled-deploy runbook, guides) now teach this flow exclusively.

### Added

- **Deployed-graph (`--graph`) materialization mode** — point the
  materializer at a property graph that already exists in BigQuery instead of
  a local DDL file. Available on every surface: `bqaa context-graph --graph`
  (CLI; accepts a bare name resolved in `--dataset-id`, or qualified
  `dataset.graph` / `project.dataset.graph`),
  `run_materialize_window(graph=...)` (Python API), `BQAA_GRAPH` (scheduled
  `run_job.py`), `deploy_cloud_run_job.sh --graph`, and the Terraform
  module's `graph` variable. The SDK fetches the normalized `CREATE PROPERTY
  GRAPH` statement from the dataset-qualified
  `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PROPERTY_GRAPHS` view and feeds the existing
  schema-derive pipeline; a missing graph fails with an error that lists the
  graphs the dataset does contain. In deployed-graph deploys nothing is
  staged into the image and the entity-table bootstrap is skipped (the
  graph's existence proves its node/edge tables exist). Mutually exclusive
  with `--property-graph` and `--ontology`/`--binding`; incompatible with
  `--extraction-mode=compiled-only` (no reference extractors are staged in
  derived mode).

### Changed

- **Docs teach only the deployed-graph flow.** The codelab (+ regenerated
  Colab notebook), blog post, scheduled Context Graph deploy runbook, the
  Conversational Analytics-first guide, and the example READMEs now apply the
  table DDL + `CREATE PROPERTY GRAPH` to BigQuery as the one-time deploy step
  and materialize with `--graph` / `BQAA_GRAPH` / `graph =`. The file-based
  `--property-graph` mode from 0.3.3 keeps working for existing scripts and
  images but is no longer documented; prefer `--graph`.

## [0.3.3] - 2026-06-08

### Release highlights

Schema-derived Context Graph materialization, end to end. `bqaa context-graph
--property-graph property_graph.sql` now derives the ontology + binding from the
property graph plus live table schemas, so rename-free graphs need no
hand-written `ontology.yaml` / `binding.yaml` — and the same one-artifact flow
reaches the scheduled production path (Cloud Run deploy script, image builder,
`run_job.py`, and the Terraform module), with a split read-only-events /
writable-graph dataset contract. Explicit `--ontology` / `--binding` is retained
as the advanced override for descriptions, inheritance, derived properties,
renames, and the migration-v5 compiled-extractor path.

### Added

- **Schema-derived (`--property-graph`) materialization, local → production**
  (local: [#277](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/issues/277)
  via [#278](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/pull/278)–[#281](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/pull/281),
  [#285](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/pull/285),
  [#287](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/pull/287);
  deploy: [#286](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/issues/286)
  via [#288](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/pull/288)–[#292](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/pull/292))
  — `bqaa context-graph --property-graph property_graph.sql` derives the ontology
  + binding from the property graph + live table schemas, so no hand-written
  `ontology.yaml` / `binding.yaml` is needed for rename-free graphs. Scheduled
  production reaches parity: the Cloud Run deploy script, image builder,
  `run_job.py` (`BQAA_PROPERTY_GRAPH`), and the Terraform module all accept the
  one-artifact flow (placeholdered `property_graph.sql` + sibling
  `table_ddl.sql`), with a split read-only-events / writable-graph contract
  (events read-only; graph tables + `_bqaa_materialization_state` land in the
  graph dataset). Explicit `--ontology`/`--binding` is preserved as the advanced
  override (descriptions, inheritance, derived properties, renames, the
  migration-v5 compiled extractor).
- **Selectable `AI.GENERATE` extraction model**
  ([#298](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/pull/298))
  — choose the model for the `ai-fallback` extraction across every surface:
  `run_materialize_window(endpoint=...)` (Python API), `bqaa context-graph
  --endpoint` (CLI), and `BQAA_ENDPOINT` for the scheduled `run_job.py` deploy.
  Short names resolve to the Vertex `locations/global` publisher URL, so Gemini
  3.x models such as `gemini-3.5-flash` work. Defaults to `gemini-2.5-flash`
  everywhere, so existing callers are unaffected; ignored under
  `--extraction-mode=compiled-only` (no AI call is made).

### Fixed

- **`run_job.py` table-DDL bootstrap mis-split on statement boundaries**
  ([#286](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/issues/286))
  — `_bootstrap_entity_tables` split the DDL on `;` without accounting for
  comments or quoting, so a `;` inside a `--` comment (e.g. the codelab
  `table_ddl.sql`'s "materializer fills automatically; they are required")
  produced a comment-only fragment BigQuery rejected with "Unexpected end of
  statement" — and a `;` or `--` inside a string literal
  (`OPTIONS(description="has; semicolon")`, `DEFAULT 'a;b'`) or a backtick
  identifier could corrupt a customer's DDL. Replaced with a quote- and
  comment-aware splitter: it strips `--` line comments and `/* */` block
  comments and splits on `;` only at the top level (never inside `'`, `"`, or
  `` ` `` quoting). Found by a live `--property-graph` deploy smoke.

### Changed

- **Renamed the context-graph example for product-facing clarity**
  ([#282](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/issues/282))
  — `examples/migration_v5/` → `examples/context_graph/` (the `migration_v5`
  label was internal milestone bookkeeping). The scheduled-deploy entrypoints
  move with it (`examples/context_graph/periodic_materialization/...`). The
  demo's default BigQuery dataset is now `context_graph` (was `migration_v5_demo`)
  and the Terraform example's graph dataset is `context_graph` (was
  `migration_v5_graph`). The user-facing docs (blog, codelab, runbook, deploy +
  Terraform READMEs) now lead with the one-artifact `property_graph.sql` path as
  primary and frame explicit `ontology.yaml` / `binding.yaml` as the advanced
  override. The previously executed demo notebook is archived as
  `examples/_archive/context_graph_historical_notebook.ipynb`. **Action for
  users:** update any deep links to `examples/migration_v5/...` and any reference
  to the `migration_v5_demo` dataset.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-05-22

### Release highlights

The migration-v5 production track lands the design-partner asks from
[#187](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/issues/187)
end-to-end: backfill mode, compiled-only extraction (with zero-LLM
guarantee), explicit FK→PK mapping that re-enables MAKO self-edges,
an opt-in orphan-session watchdog, the Beat 5 feedback / reward
loop in both the demo and the live notebook, hardened deploy
defaults (split SAs + tunable retries), and a Terraform module
mirroring the bash deploy. The migration-v5 cron path is now
complete for audit-critical production deployments.

### Added

- **Backfill mode for `materialize_window`** ([#188](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/pull/188),
  closes [#177](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/issues/177))
  — `bqaa-materialize-window --backfill --from / --to --state-key-suffix`
  runs a one-shot historical window with isolated state-table
  rows (the suffix folds into the `state_key` hash, so backfill
  rows can't advance the steady-state cron checkpoint).
- **Compiled-only extraction mode + deploy path** ([#192](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/pull/192),
  [#193](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/pull/193),
  closes [#178](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/issues/178))
  — `--extraction-mode=compiled-only` routes the orchestrator
  through structured extractors only, never calls `AI.GENERATE`,
  surfaces uncovered spans as typed `empty_extraction` failures
  with sample diagnostics. The deploy script (`#193`) stages
  `reference_extractor.py` into the container, wires
  `BQAA_REFERENCE_EXTRACTORS_MODULE`, and makes
  `roles/aiplatform.user` conditional (idempotently removes the
  grant when transitioning an existing ai-fallback deploy to
  compiled-only). `TestCompiledOnlyMakesZeroLLMCalls` proves the
  zero-LLM contract.
- **Explicit FK→PK mapping for binding columns** ([#191](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/pull/191),
  [#222](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/pull/222),
  closes [#179](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/issues/179))
  — `from_columns` / `to_columns` accept `list[dict[str, str]]`
  shape (`[{src_decision_execution_id: id}]`) in addition to the
  legacy `list[str]`. Materializer, validators, and the PG DDL
  compiler consume the canonical
  `ResolvedRelationship.from_column_mapping`. MAKO's
  `evolvedFrom` / `supersededBy` self-edges are re-added to the
  migration v5 binding.
- **Orphan-session watchdog** ([#224](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/pull/224),
  closes [#180](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/issues/180))
  — opt-in via `--max-session-age-hours N`. Each cron pass scans
  for sessions whose first event is older than the cutoff but
  which never emitted `AGENT_COMPLETED`; flags them as
  `session_orphaned` failures and records the running set in the
  state table (`mode='orphan_scan'` + `mode='orphan_ledger'`
  rows). Strict `>` watermark, explicit timestamp-bound partition
  pruning on the resolved-orphan probe.
- **Migration v5 Beat 5 — feedback / reward loop** ([#227](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/pull/227),
  [#228](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/pull/228),
  closes [#181](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/issues/181),
  [#184](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/issues/184),
  [#185](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/issues/185))
  — demo scope grows from 6 → 11 entities and 9 → 14
  relationships. Adds `BusinessConstraint`,
  `ConstraintApplication`, `RejectionReason`, `OutcomeSignal`,
  `RewardComputation` + their edges. The demo agent emits four
  new tools (`apply_constraint`, `record_rejection`,
  `record_outcome_signal`, `compute_reward`); the reference
  extractor covers all four; the notebook's new Beat 5 cells run
  the two payoff GQL traversals end-to-end against a live
  BigQuery scratch dataset (29 / 29 cells executed, counts 1–29,
  6 unique reward rows + 8 unique rejection rows verified live).
- **Split runtime + scheduler-caller SAs by default** ([#230](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/pull/230),
  closes [#182](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/issues/182))
  — `deploy_cloud_run_job.sh` creates two SAs by default:
  `bqaa-periodic-runtime-sa` (BigQuery + Vertex AI roles) and
  `bqaa-periodic-scheduler-sa` (only `roles/run.invoker` on the
  job). `--single-sa` is the escape hatch for the pre-#182
  combined identity. Least-privilege: scheduler-caller never
  needs BigQuery permissions.
- **Tunable `--max-retries` on Cloud Run Job** ([#230](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/pull/230),
  closes [#183](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/issues/183))
  — default 2 (was hard-coded 1). The orchestrator's session-
  level idempotency + append-only state table make additional
  retries safe. The retry count flows into `BQAA_MAX_RETRIES` on
  the job's env so the runtime's startup log surfaces it in
  `jsonPayload.max_retries` — operators correlating Cloud
  Monitoring alert noise with retry behaviour see the policy
  without `gcloud run jobs describe`.
- **Terraform module for periodic materialization** ([#231](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/pull/231),
  closes [#186](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/issues/186))
  — `examples/migration_v5/periodic_materialization/terraform/`
  mirrors the bash deploy's resources (graph dataset, both SAs,
  IAM bindings, Cloud Run v2 Job, Scheduler trigger) with
  defaults matching `deploy_cloud_run_job.sh`'s post-#230
  surface. New `build_image.sh` helper produces the staging
  layout the runtime needs. Image build/publish are intentionally
  outside the module — `var.image_uri` takes the published
  container image. `var.manage_apis` enables the required APIs
  on a clean project; `var.deletion_protection` matches the bash
  deploy's lifecycle. Live-verified end-to-end against
  `test-project-0728-467323`.

### Fixed

- **Orphan-watchdog empty-array streaming-insert crash hotfix** ([#225](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/pull/225))
  — BigQuery's streaming-insert API rejects empty
  `ARRAY<STRING>` values with `Field value of
  flagged_session_ids cannot be empty.`. Pre-fix, every cron
  pass after [#224](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/pull/224)
  crashed at insert time. Fix: omit nullable columns from the
  `insert_rows_json` payload when their value is `None` or
  empty.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-05-18

### Release highlights

Focused follow-up to 0.3.0 that publishes the periodic-materialization
production path. The `bqaa-materialize-window` CLI merged after the
0.3.0 cut, so customers `pip install`-ing the SDK couldn't run the
cron path the migration v5 playbook documents. 0.3.1 closes that gap
and ships the surrounding deployment artifacts and a behavior fix:

- **`bqaa-materialize-window` CLI on PyPI** ([#162](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/pull/162))
  — cron-friendly scheduled-graph-refresh command, available as a
  standalone console script and as a `bq-agent-sdk materialize-window`
  subcommand.
- **Empty-extraction silent-failure mode closed** ([#167](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/pull/167))
  — `ok=true` is now an honest signal; per-session extraction
  failures classify as `empty_extraction` vs `materialization_failed`
  and flip `ok=false`. **Operator-visible behavior change** (see
  Fixed).
- **Cloud Run Job + Cloud Scheduler example** ([#165](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/pull/165),
  [#166](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/pull/166))
  — packaged deployment template under
  `examples/migration_v5/periodic_materialization/` with
  one-command deploy + `--smoke` end-to-end verification.
- **Customer playbook** ([#168](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/pull/168))
  — the production cron path documented end-to-end: required
  APIs/IAM, recommended schedules, JSON log shape, Cloud Monitoring
  alerts, state-table inspection, teardown, troubleshooting.

### Added

- **`bqaa-materialize-window` console script** (PR
  [#162](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/pull/162)).
  New cron-friendly entry point for keeping the materialized graph
  fresh on a schedule. Shipped as a standalone console script
  (`bqaa-materialize-window`) and as a `bq-agent-sdk
  materialize-window` subcommand; both call paths share
  `src/bigquery_agent_analytics/materialize_window.py`. Terminal-
  event-driven discovery (`event_type = @completion_event_type`,
  partition-pruned), pinned `run_started_at` snapshot, append-only
  state table keyed on a content-derived `state_key` (project +
  dataset + graph + events_table + ontology fingerprint + binding
  fingerprint + discovery mode), overlap-windowed re-scan for
  late-arriving events, per-session loop with idempotent retries
  and checkpoint advance only on success, worst-status-wins
  per-table aggregation, structured JSON report with C2 compiled-
  extractor outcome counters (`compiled_unchanged` /
  `compiled_filtered` / `fallback_for_event`), binding-validate
  pre-flight, checkpoint that never regresses across overlap
  re-scans, numeric/identifier guardrails at the boundary. Exit
  codes: `0` clean, `1` expected failure (session error or
  binding drift), `2` unexpected internal error.

- **Migration v5 Cloud Run Job + Cloud Scheduler example** in
  [`examples/migration_v5/periodic_materialization/`](examples/migration_v5/periodic_materialization/)
  (PRs
  [#165](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/pull/165),
  [#166](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/pull/166)).
  Packaged Cloud Run Job + Cloud Scheduler deployment that wraps
  `bqaa-materialize-window` for the migration v5 binding. One-
  command `deploy_cloud_run_job.sh` creates a runtime service
  account with narrow IAM (`dataViewer` on the events dataset,
  `dataEditor` on the graph dataset, `bigquery.jobUser` +
  `aiplatform.user` at the project, `run.invoker` on the job for
  the scheduler SA), deploys the job, wires the Cloud Scheduler
  trigger, and optionally runs `--smoke` to verify end-to-end in
  one shot. IAM matrix, dataset-role contract (events read-only,
  graph read/write), and live-deploy evidence captured against the
  canonical test project.

- **Migration v5 periodic materialization playbook** in
  [`examples/migration_v5/periodic_materialization/README.md`](examples/migration_v5/periodic_materialization/README.md)
  (PR [#168](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/pull/168)).
  Documents the customer path for keeping the MAKO graph fresh on
  a schedule: local dry-run via `run_job.py`, Cloud Run Job +
  Cloud Scheduler deployment with `--smoke`, required APIs and
  IAM, recommended schedules, Cloud Logging JSON report shape,
  Cloud Monitoring alerts, state-table inspection, teardown, and
  troubleshooting. Complements the migration v5 four-guarantee
  notebook by covering the production cron path.

### Fixed

- **`materialize-window` no longer reports `ok=true` on silent
  extraction failures** (PR
  [#167](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/pull/167)).
  Previously, when per-event extraction returned an empty graph
  (e.g., runtime SA missing `roles/aiplatform.user` so every
  `AI.GENERATE` call failed and was swallowed), the orchestrator
  reported `sessions_materialized == sessions_discovered`,
  `ok=true`, and an empty `rows_materialized` dict. Operators
  alerting on `jsonPayload.ok` saw "all good" while the entity
  tables stayed empty. Now, after `materialize_with_status`
  succeeds, the orchestrator inspects the materialized rows and
  per-table statuses; sessions producing zero materialized rows
  break the loop and classify the failure as
  `empty_extraction` (extraction returned empty — check AI/IAM)
  or `materialization_failed` (extraction produced rows but every
  insert failed — check write perms / schema). `ok=false` is the
  unmistakable red signal, and `failures[].error_code`
  distinguishes the failure mode without log digging. Per-table
  statuses now also surface in `result.table_statuses` for
  failed sessions (previously only `ok` sessions contributed).
  **Operator-visible behavior change**: alerts on
  `jsonPayload.ok=false` are sufficient; no second-line
  `rows_materialized == {}` check needed. The empty-window
  heartbeat path (`sessions_discovered == 0`) is unchanged — an
  idle cron firing still reports `ok=true`.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-15

### Release highlights

Substantial feature release covering three major workstreams that landed
between 0.2.3 and 0.3.0:

- **Compiled structured extractors — full Phase C pipeline**
  ([#75](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/issues/75))
  — deterministic source generation, JSON-to-plan parsing, LLM-driven plan
  resolution, retry-on-gate-failure orchestration, runtime fallback wiring,
  runtime extractor-registry adapter, orchestrator call-site swap,
  compile-and-measure utility, revalidation harness, BigQuery-table bundle
  mirror, ``bqaa-revalidate-extractors`` CLI with ``--events-bq-query-file``,
  and an operational rollout guide. Replaces per-event LLM extraction with
  deterministic code on the hot path while preserving the LLM fallback for
  unrecognized event shapes.
- **Ontology runtime reader**
  ([#58](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/issues/58)
  reader follow-on to PR #92's concept-index emission) —
  ``OntologyRuntime`` façade, ``EntityResolver`` Protocol with two reference
  implementations (``ExactEntityResolver``, ``LabelSynonymResolver``), and
  ``ConceptIndexLookup`` with fingerprint-strict verification across three
  trust points (eager ``verify()`` at construction, explicit re-checks,
  per-query ``WHERE compile_fingerprint`` defense in depth). Stable failure
  codes (``FingerprintMismatchError``, ``MetaTableMissingError``,
  ``MetaTableEmptyError``, ``MetaTableMultipleRowsError``).
- **Binding + extraction validation toolkit**
  ([#76](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/issues/76),
  [#105](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/issues/105))
  — ``validate_extracted_graph(...)``,
  ``validate_extracted_graph_from_ontology(...)``,
  ``validate_binding_against_bigquery(...)`` Python APIs;
  ``bq-agent-sdk binding-validate`` CLI for pre-flight validation;
  ``ontology-build --validate-binding`` and ``--location`` flags.

Examples shipped alongside the SDK release: the MAKO four-guarantee notebook
demonstrating the compiled-extractor pipeline end-to-end
([#107](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/issues/107)),
and the A2A joint-lineage demo with auditor projections, the receiver
``A2A_INTERACTION`` typed view, and an audit-analyst agent that closes the
BQAA loop
([#129](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/issues/129)).

### Added

- **``A2A_INTERACTION`` typed view (``adk_a2a_interactions``)** in
  ``src/bigquery_agent_analytics/views.py`` (PR
  [#136](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/pull/136)).
  Surfaces the BQ AA Plugin's caller-side A2A delegation rows
  with JSON-extracted lineage columns —
  ``a2a_task_id``, ``a2a_context_id``, ``a2a_request``,
  ``a2a_response``, plus a ``receiver_session_id_from_response``
  COALESCE — so downstream consumers can join caller and receiver
  traces without writing the JSON-extraction SQL by hand. Used by
  the A2A joint-lineage demo's auditor projection.
- **``CodeEvaluator.context_cache_hit_rate(...)`` + CLI support**
  (PR [#114](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/pull/114)).
  New pre-built evaluator in
  ``src/bigquery_agent_analytics/evaluators.py`` that measures
  Gemini context-cache prefix-hit rate
  (``cached_tokens / input_tokens``) per session, with
  cold-start / warm rate thresholds and an explicit
  ``fail_on_missing_telemetry`` switch. Wired through the
  ``bqaa evaluate --evaluator context_cache_hit_rate`` CLI path
  (``src/bigquery_agent_analytics/cli.py``).
- **``gm compile --emit-concept-index`` / ``--concept-index-table``**
  CLI flags in ``src/bigquery_ontology/cli.py`` (PR
  [#92](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/pull/92),
  issue
  [#58](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/issues/58)
  Phase 1). Emits a fingerprint-stamped concept-index table
  (``label`` / ``synonym`` / ``notation`` rows + ``__meta``)
  that the ontology runtime reader (above) verifies against.
  ``--concept-index-table`` is required when ``--emit-concept-index``
  is set — no silent global default.
- **``ontology-build --skip-property-graph``** flag in
  ``src/bigquery_agent_analytics/cli.py`` (PR
  [#108](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/pull/108),
  issue
  [#104](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/issues/104)).
  Materializes node and edge tables without issuing the
  ``CREATE OR REPLACE PROPERTY GRAPH`` statement, letting users
  own their property-graph DDL while still letting the SDK
  populate the backing tables.
- **Ontology runtime reader** in
  ``bigquery_agent_analytics.ontology_runtime`` and
  [`docs/ontology_runtime_reader.md`](docs/ontology_runtime_reader.md).
  Issue [#58](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/issues/58)
  reader follow-on to PR #92's concept-index emission.
  Public surface:
  * ``OntologyRuntime`` — façade that loads
    ``Ontology + Binding`` (from YAML files or in-memory
    models) plus an optional :class:`ConceptIndexLookup`
    wired to the emitted BigQuery table. Read-only
    accessors over entities / relationships / synonyms /
    annotations / SKOS schemes / notations / labels;
    provenance properties (``compile_fingerprint`` /
    ``compile_id``) computed locally.
  * ``EntityResolver`` Protocol + two reference
    implementations: ``ExactEntityResolver`` (in-memory
    match on ``entity_name``, no BQ roundtrip) and
    ``LabelSynonymResolver`` (BQ-backed match against the
    concept-index ``label`` / ``synonym`` / ``notation``
    rows, re-ranked by label-kind priority
    ``name > pref > alt > hidden > synonym > notation``).
    **No embedding / LLM / fuzzy in this slice** — explicit
    non-goals; future PRs can implement the Protocol
    without touching the runtime surface.
  * ``ConceptIndexLookup`` — BigQuery-backed accessor that
    is **fingerprint-strict**. Three trust points: eager
    ``verify()`` at construction (compares the table's
    ``__meta`` row against the locally-computed
    ``compile_fingerprint(ontology_fp, binding_fp,
    compiler_version)``); explicit ``verify()`` method for
    re-checks before long batches; per-query
    ``WHERE compile_fingerprint = @expected_fp`` as defense
    in depth so stale rows can't surface even mid-flight.
    Three lookup methods: ``lookup_by_label`` (with
    label-kind / language / case-insensitive filters),
    ``lookup_by_entity_name``, ``lookup_by_notation``.
    Stable failure codes: ``FingerprintMismatchError``,
    ``MetaTableMissingError``, ``MetaTableEmptyError``,
    ``MetaTableMultipleRowsError`` — all subclass
    ``ConceptIndexError``.
  CI suite (55 cases) uses in-memory fake BQ clients;
  live test (gated behind ``BQAA_RUN_LIVE_ONTOLOGY_RUNTIME_TESTS=1``)
  emits a real concept-index via PR #92's path, attaches
  the runtime, runs resolver queries against the live
  table, asserts provenance, drops the tables on the way
  out. Closes the last feature dependency for #107's
  four-guarantee notebook (the resolve beat).
- **Compiled-extractor rollout guide** at
  [`docs/extractor_compilation_rollout_guide.md`](docs/extractor_compilation_rollout_guide.md).
  Operational playbook for the Phase C pipeline (issue
  [#75](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/issues/75))
  stitching the five stages — Compile, Publish, Sync, Wire,
  Revalidate — into one flow. Treats Publish/Sync as the
  remote-runtime path; local / co-located deployments can
  shortcut to Compile → Wire → Revalidate. Worked BKA
  example uses Python snippets for the non-CLI stages
  (``measure_compile``, ``publish_bundles_to_bq``,
  ``sync_bundles_from_bq``,
  ``OntologyGraphManager.from_bundles_root``) and the real
  ``bqaa-revalidate-extractors`` shell invocation only
  where a CLI actually exists. Documents the **four trust
  gates** across the pipeline — the compile-time smoke gate
  inside ``compile_extractor`` (``load_callable_from_source``
  + ``run_smoke_test``, not ``load_bundle`` itself: there's
  no manifest at compile time) plus three real
  ``load_bundle`` runs at pre-publish, post-sync, and
  runtime-startup discovery — so the trust model is one
  mental model across the pipeline.
  Includes a failure-recovery playbook keyed on the stable
  failure codes each stage emits.
- **``--events-bq-query-file`` for ``bqaa-revalidate-extractors``**
  (issue [#75](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/issues/75)
  CLI follow-up). The CLI now accepts a BigQuery event
  source in addition to ``--events-jsonl``; the two are
  mutually exclusive and exactly one must be supplied.
  Contract: the SQL must produce exactly one column named
  ``event_json`` (STRING) per row, containing a JSON-encoded
  event dict — same shape ``--events-jsonl`` consumes
  line-by-line. The CLI does NOT auto-shape
  ``bigquery.Row`` objects; the query writer controls
  projection via ``TO_JSON_STRING(STRUCT(...))``. Row-level
  errors (missing column, non-string value, malformed JSON,
  non-dict decode) surface as exit 2 with the 0-based row
  index named so an operator can find the offender with
  ``LIMIT N OFFSET row_index``. BigQuery-side exceptions
  (auth, syntax, table-not-found, permission) are caught and
  surfaced with type + message — no traceback escapes.
  ``--bq-project`` is optional: the BigQuery client falls
  back to Application Default Credentials / environment for
  project inference; if both are absent the CLI exits 2 with
  ``Set --bq-project explicitly`` rather than confusing the
  operator with a downstream API error. ``--bq-location``
  defaults to ``US``. Client construction is centralized
  behind ``_make_bq_client(project, location)`` so unit
  tests inject in-memory fakes via ``monkeypatch.setattr``
  rather than wiring through every call site. CI tests
  (11 new cases) cover the happy path, ADC inference,
  no-project-anywhere, query exceptions, every row-shape
  failure mode, the mutex on event sources (both / neither),
  and the empty-SQL-file edge. Live BQ test
  (``tests/test_extractor_compilation_cli_revalidate_bq_live.py``)
  is gated behind ``BQAA_RUN_LIVE_BQ_REVALIDATE_TESTS=1``;
  it creates a temp table, inserts two ``event_json`` rows,
  runs the CLI, asserts the report is written with both
  events as compiled_unchanged + parity_matches, deletes
  the table on the way out.
- **``bqaa-revalidate-extractors`` CLI** in
  `bigquery_agent_analytics.extractor_compilation.cli_revalidate`
  and
  [`docs/extractor_compilation_revalidate_cli.md`](docs/extractor_compilation_revalidate_cli.md).
  Issue [#75](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/issues/75)
  follow-up to Milestone C2.d — operationalizes
  ``revalidate_compiled_extractors`` so ops can run periodic
  revalidation without writing Python. **Local inputs
  only** this round; ``--events-bq-query`` lands in a
  follow-up so the auth/location/pagination surface gets
  isolated from the operational-loop contract.
  Flags: ``--bundles-root`` (auto-detects the fingerprint
  from the first bundle's manifest; mixed fingerprints
  fail-closed), ``--events-jsonl`` (one event per line,
  malformed lines abort with line number), ``--reference-
  extractors-module`` (dotted path; module exposes
  ``EXTRACTORS: dict[str, callable]``, ``RESOLVED_GRAPH``
  from ``resolve(ontology, binding)``, and optionally
  ``SPEC`` — the CLI carries no ontology/binding flags
  because the reference module owns the validator-input
  contract), ``--thresholds-json`` (optional; JSON object
  with any subset of ``RevalidationThresholds`` fields,
  bounds-checked via the existing ``__post_init__``),
  ``--report-out`` (combined JSON of the raw
  ``RevalidationReport`` plus the ``ThresholdCheckResult``).
  Exit codes are deliberately narrow: ``0`` pass / ``1``
  threshold violation (report still written) / ``2``
  usage-or-input error (report not written). Wired through
  ``pyproject.toml [project.scripts]`` so
  ``pip install`` exposes the binary.
- **BigQuery-table bundle mirror** in
  `bigquery_agent_analytics.extractor_compilation.bq_bundle_mirror`
  and
  [`docs/extractor_compilation_bq_bundle_mirror.md`](docs/extractor_compilation_bq_bundle_mirror.md).
  Issue [#75](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/issues/75)
  PR C2.c.3 — publishes compiled bundles to a BigQuery
  table and syncs them back into a local directory for
  C2.a's existing loader. Runtime path stays
  ``sync_bundles_from_bq → discover_bundles →
  from_bundles_root``; the mirror is a utility, not a
  runtime loader. Public surface:
  ``publish_bundles_to_bq(bundle_root, store,
  bundle_fingerprint_allowlist=None)`` and
  ``sync_bundles_from_bq(store, dest_dir,
  bundle_fingerprint_allowlist=None)``. Both call
  :func:`load_bundle` as a gate — publish refuses bundles
  that wouldn't load at the runtime; sync refuses bundles
  whose reconstruction the loader rejects, scrubbing any
  partial directory it wrote. Sync writes each
  fingerprint to a side-by-side **staging directory** and
  runs ``load_bundle`` on the staged copy before performing
  a **staged replace** of the target (the rmtree+move pair
  is not strictly atomic — a crash between the two leaves
  the bundle absent on disk, recoverable by re-sync — but
  the load-bundle-failure direction *is* atomic, so a bad
  mirror row never destroys a previously-good local
  bundle).
  Strict bundle-shape check: the table stores exactly two
  rows per fingerprint (``manifest.json`` + the manifest's
  ``module_filename``); ``unexpected_file`` codes reject
  anything else. The manifest's own ``module_filename`` is
  shape-checked at sync (bare filename — no separators, no
  ``..``, no NUL); a path-separator value surfaces as
  ``manifest_row_unreadable`` instead of raising
  ``FileNotFoundError`` at the write step.
  ``invalid_bundle_path`` rejects traversal / absolute /
  backslash / NUL paths before writing to disk.
  ``duplicate_row`` rejects two rows sharing the same
  ``(fingerprint, bundle_path)`` (BigQuery has no unique
  constraint; the mirror enforces uniqueness at sync).
  ``duplicate_fingerprint`` rejects publish-side cases
  where two subdirs of ``bundle_root`` claim the same
  manifest fingerprint — neither is published, so the
  table can't end up with logical duplicates.
  ``malformed_row`` rejects rows with wrong field types.
  Idempotent republish via DELETE+INSERT in
  ``BigQueryBundleStore.publish_rows`` —
  re-publishing the same fingerprint replaces the prior
  rows rather than accumulating duplicates. The DELETE +
  ``insert_rows_json`` are NOT a single atomic
  transaction; a transient INSERT failure leaves rows
  missing until the caller re-runs publish (recoverable;
  documented in the class docstring).
  ``publish_rows`` also raises ``ValueError`` on duplicate
  ``(fingerprint, bundle_path)`` input pairs as defense in
  depth.
  ``BundleStore`` is a Protocol so tests can pass in-memory
  fakes; ``BigQueryBundleStore`` is the concrete
  implementation wrapping ``google.cloud.bigquery``.
  ``BUNDLE_MIRROR_TABLE_SCHEMA`` is exported for callers
  who need to create the table themselves (or
  ``BigQueryBundleStore.ensure_table()`` does it
  idempotently). Failure codes are stable strings;
  per-bundle problems land in ``failures`` instead of
  raising. Store exceptions (BQ-side: network, auth, table
  missing) propagate. Out of scope: GCS-backed signed-URL
  fetch, caching / TTL, garbage collection, multi-region
  replication.

  in
  `bigquery_agent_analytics.extractor_compilation.revalidation`
  and
  [`docs/extractor_compilation_revalidation.md`](docs/extractor_compilation_revalidation.md).
  Issue [#75](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/issues/75)
  PR C2.d — turns the compiled path from "works in tests" into
  "keeps proving itself after rollout." Public surface:
  ``revalidate_compiled_extractors(events,
  compiled_extractors, reference_extractors, resolved_graph,
  ...)`` drives ``run_with_fallback`` (with a no-op fallback)
  over a batch of events AND calls the reference extractor
  directly, aggregating the per-event outcomes into a
  ``RevalidationReport`` with **two orthogonal dimensions**:
  (1) runtime decision — per-event-type ``EventTypeCounts``
  plus totals for ``compiled_unchanged`` /
  ``compiled_filtered`` / ``fallback_for_event``, with
  ``compiled_path_faults`` split out so bundle bugs (the
  wrapper's ``compiled_exception`` audit field covers
  exceptions, wrong return type, and malformed result
  internals) are distinguishable from ontology drift; (2)
  agreement against reference — ``parity_matches`` /
  ``parity_divergences`` / ``parity_not_checked`` using a
  three-comparator parity check: ``_compare_nodes`` and
  ``_compare_span_handling`` from ``measurement.py`` plus
  ``_compare_edges`` in ``revalidation.py`` (same edge_id
  set with matching relationship_name / endpoints / property-
  set per shared edge; duplicate edge_ids on either side
  reported as a divergence rather than silently collapsed by
  dict keying, since #76 doesn't enforce edge-id
  uniqueness). The parity dimension catches **schema-valid
  but semantically wrong** outputs the validator would
  silently accept. **Every failure mode on the reference
  side becomes a parity divergence, never a batch abort**:
  exceptions, non-``StructuredExtractionResult`` returns
  (including ``None``), and comparator crashes all funnel
  into the divergence channel with a descriptive string. Headline KPIs:
  ``compiled_unchanged_rate`` (schema safety) and
  ``parity_match_rate`` (semantic agreement; denominator
  excludes ``parity_not_checked`` so wrapper-filtered events
  don't conflate with wrong-output events). Sample
  divergences are capped (per-dimension, independently) at 10
  by default. Skipped events (event_types without a compiled
  or reference extractor, malformed events) are counted
  separately from the rate denominators.
  ``check_thresholds(report, RevalidationThresholds(...))``
  evaluates the same report against policy gates;
  ``RevalidationThresholds`` validates rates are in
  ``[0, 1]`` (and rejects NaN / bool) at construction so a
  typo like ``max_fallback_for_event_rate=5`` fails loud
  instead of silently disabling the gate. Multiple
  thresholds all evaluated (no short-circuit), violations as
  human-readable strings naming the failed rate and bound.
  ``RevalidationReport.to_json()`` is deterministic for
  persistence + cross-run diffing. Out of scope (deferred):
  scheduled / cron orchestration, BigQuery / disk
  persistence, CLI binary, sampling strategy, auto-fix
  workflows.

  ``runtime_registry.bundles_without_fallback`` /
  ``fallbacks_without_bundle`` /  ``discovery.failures`` for

  ``from_ontology_binding`` paths are unchanged — direct-
  constructor callers leave ``runtime_registry = None`` and
  back-compat holds by construction. Compiled-only event_types
  without a matching fallback are NOT registered (fail-closed
  per C2.b's safety contract). Out of scope (deferred): BQ-

  ``extractors`` dict is ready to pass straight into the
  existing ``run_structured_extractors`` hook. Wiring matrix:
  compiled+fallback → wrapped closure that calls
  ``run_with_fallback``; fallback-only → original callable
  registered unchanged; **compiled-only → skipped and recorded
  in ``bundles_without_fallback``** (C2's safety contract
  requires a fallback; fail-closed default). The inverse
  ``fallbacks_without_bundle`` audit surface records every
  event_type whose fallback has *no usable compiled registry
  entry* — that includes "bundle never built" and "bundle
  exists but discovery rejected it" (fingerprint mismatch,
  collision, ``manifest_unreadable``); rollout telemetry that
  wants to distinguish those cases should cross-reference
  ``discovery.failures``. ``fallback_extractors`` values are
  validated to be callable at build time (rejects ``None`` /
  non-callable with a ``TypeError`` naming the offending
  event_type) so misconfiguration surfaces immediately rather
  than silently in ``run_structured_extractors``.
  ``event_type_allowlist`` filters both candidate pools. The
  ``on_outcome`` callback fires on every wrapped invocation

## [0.2.3] - 2026-04-27

### Fixed

- **LLM-as-Judge AI.GENERATE path now executes against current
  BigQuery.** Earlier versions emitted a table-valued
  ``FROM session_traces, AI.GENERATE(...) AS result`` shape with
  ``output_schema`` and a flat ``model_params`` dict. Current
  ``AI.GENERATE`` is a scalar function that returns a STRUCT;
  the table-valued form raises ``Table-valued function not found``
  and the flat ``model_params`` raises ``does not conform to the
  GenerateContent request body``. Mocked unit tests passed because
  they bypassed real query execution. The SDK now renders a
  ``SELECT AI.GENERATE(...).score, ...`` query with a
  ``generationConfig``-wrapped ``model_params`` and ``output_schema``
  on the scalar form, runs against live BigQuery, and unwraps the
  returned struct's ``score`` / ``justification`` / ``status``
  fields.
- **LLM-as-Judge AI.GENERATE / ML.GENERATE_TEXT now uses the full
  Python prompt template.** Previously both BQ-native paths sent
  only ``prompt_template.split('{trace_text}')[0]`` to BigQuery,
  silently dropping every instruction that followed the
  placeholders — including the per-criterion output-format spec
  the judge model needs to score consistently with the
  API-fallback path. The two BQ paths and the Python API path now
  produce comparable scores against the same prompt.

### Added

- ``evaluators.render_ai_generate_judge_query(...)`` is the new
  entry point that builds the AI.GENERATE batch SQL.
  ``connection_id`` is optional — when omitted the call uses
  end-user credentials; when supplied it inlines the
  ``connection_id =>`` argument so callers can route through a
  service-account-owned connection when their environment
  requires it.
- ``Client.connection_id`` already existed; it is now plumbed
  through to ``_ai_generate_judge`` so a connection set at client
  construction propagates to the judge SQL automatically.
- Live BigQuery integration tests for the LLM-judge AI.GENERATE
  path (``tests/test_ai_generate_judge_live.py``). Skipped by
  default; opt in with ``BQAA_RUN_LIVE_TESTS=1`` plus
  ``PROJECT_ID`` / ``DATASET_ID``. Three tests cover SQL parse
  acceptance, expected result-schema column names, and the
  ``connection_id`` escape hatch when
  ``BQAA_AI_GENERATE_CONNECTION_ID`` is set. Catches the class of
  mock-divergence bug that let the prior broken template ship.
- ``EvaluationReport.details["execution_mode"]`` is now populated
  for LLM-as-Judge runs with one of ``ai_generate``,
  ``ml_generate_text``, ``api_fallback``, or ``no_op`` — matching
  the value space the categorical evaluator already exposes. When
  an earlier tier raised before a later tier succeeded,
  ``details["fallback_reason"]`` carries the chained exception
  messages in attempt order, so CI and dashboards can audit which
  path actually ran.
- ``evaluators.split_judge_prompt_template(prompt_template)`` is
  the helper the SQL paths use to safely substitute the template
  into ``CONCAT()``; exposed publicly for downstream code that
  needs the same shape.
- ``bq-agent-sdk evaluate --exit-code`` FAIL lines now carry a
  bounded ``feedback="…"`` snippet drawn from
  ``SessionScore.llm_feedback`` for LLM-judge failures. The
  snippet collapses internal whitespace to a single space,
  truncates to 120 characters with an ellipsis, and is omitted
  entirely for code-based metrics (which leave ``llm_feedback``
  empty). CI logs now explain *why* the judge said the session
  failed without forcing the reader to chase the JSON output.

### Changed

- ``--strict`` help text and ``SDK.md §4`` clarified to match shipped
  behavior. ``--strict`` is a *visibility* knob — it stamps
  ``details['parse_error']=True`` on AI.GENERATE/ML.GENERATE_TEXT
  judge rows whose ``scores`` dict is empty, and adds a report-level
  ``parse_errors`` counter. It does **not** flip any session's
  pass/fail outcome: both BQ-native judge methods compute ``passed``
  as ``bool(scores) and all(...)``, so empty-scores rows already
  fail without the flag. API-fallback parse errors coerce to
  ``score=0.0``, so they fail as low-score failures rather than
  parse errors. For pass/fail-only CI consumers ``--strict`` is a
  no-op; reach for it when a dashboard needs to tell "no parseable
  score" apart from "low score."

## [0.2.2] - 2026-04-24

### Changed (breaking)

- **Prebuilt `CodeEvaluator` gates now compare raw observed values
  directly against the user-supplied budget.** `CodeEvaluator.latency`,
  `.turn_count`, `.error_rate`, `.token_efficiency`, `.ttft`, and
  `.cost_per_session` return `1.0` when the observed metric is within
  budget and `0.0` otherwise. The previous implementation scored sessions
  on a normalized `1.0 - (observed / budget)` scale against a `0.5` pass
  cutoff, which effectively fired every gate at roughly half the budget
  the user typed (e.g. `latency(threshold_ms=5000)` failed sessions at
  `avg_latency_ms > 2500`). Users relying on the old sub-budget fail
  behavior should lower their budgets to match their intent.
- The scheduled streaming evaluator (`streaming_observability_v1`) uses
  the same raw-budget gate semantics for consistency with the prebuilt
  `CodeEvaluator` factories.

### Added

- `CodeEvaluator.add_metric` accepts `observed_key`, `observed_fn`, and
  `budget` arguments that flow into `SessionScore.details[f"metric_{name}"]`
  for downstream reporting. The CLI uses these to emit readable failure
  lines without re-running the scorer.
- `bq-agent-sdk evaluate --exit-code` now prints a per-session failure
  summary on stderr before exiting non-zero. Each line names the
  session_id, failing metric, observed value, and the budget it blew
  through. Output is capped at the first 10 failing sessions to keep
  CI logs scannable.
- `bq-agent-sdk categorical-eval` gains `--exit-code`,
  `--min-pass-rate`, and `--pass-category METRIC=CATEGORY`
  (repeatable) flags. Declare which classification counts as passing
  per metric, set a minimum pass rate across the run, and fail CI when
  any metric falls below it. Multiple pass categories per metric are
  OR'd together (e.g. `--pass-category tone=positive --pass-category
  tone=neutral`). Missing metric names warn on stderr without failing
  the run so configuration mistakes are visible in CI logs.
